# Phosphor Icons

Phosphor is a flexible icon family for interfaces, diagrams, presentations — whatever, really. Explore all our icons at [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com).

## Figma Plugin

Browse, search, and copy into your project all from within Figma! To install, visit our [community page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/898620911119764089/Phosphor-Icons).

## Raw Assets

If you'd like to use the raw assets directly to modify them, click the toggle in the toolbar to change from `Flat` to `Raw`. You can also download our [asset kit](https://www.phosphoricons.com/assets/phosphor-icons.zip).

- **SVGs** – Individual icon SVGs, in both minified and original formats retaining design-time detail.
- **Icon Font** – Use the icons as you would text, in print and other applications where full-fledged graphical elements are undesirable.
